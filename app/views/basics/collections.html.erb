Many collections are from cultivated plants in North America and Europe, and have provided the basis for Baileyâ€™s publications in the 1920s and 1930s as well as more recent research by Hortorium staff. Native and cultivated specimens from China, Japan and New Caledonia, and extensive collections made by J. T. Buchholz in the late 1940s are prominent.",
