																intro: "had a long and prestigeous career studying Germanic languages and philology.  \
																				At the same time, Andrews avocationally pursued his interests in bryophytes.  \
																				His lifelong endeavors with mosses and liverworts would earn him a reputation as one of the world's foremost bryologists.",
																connection: "Andrews got a position in the German Department at Cornell Universityin 1908, \
																						he rose to Assistant Professor (1919), Professor (1931), and Professor Emeritus (1946). \
																						He assembled a bryophyte collection in the Wiegand Herbarium, and was appointed Honorary Curator of the bryophyte collection in 1953.",
																bio: "A. LeRoy Andrews was born on December 27, 1878 in Williamstown, Massachusetts. \
																			He grew up in Williamstown, but lack of a good botany program at nearby Williams College led Andrews to study languages there. \
																			He graduated from Williams in 1899 and received his M.A. from Williams in 1902. \
																			Following graduate study in German at Harvard University, and brief teaching posts at West Virginia University and Darmouth College, \
																			Andrews studied at Berlin, Kiel, Oslo, and Copenhagen, receiving his Ph.D. from Kiel in 1908. \
																			It was then that Andrews joined the German Department at Cornell University to teach German and Scandinavian languages. \
																			He became Assistant Professor in 1919, Professor in 1931, and Professor Emeritus in 1946. \
																			Though his primary career followed the path of Germanic languages, Andrews also distinquished himself in bryology. \
																			Wherever his German travels took him, he also studied the region's bryology. \
																			His publications in Germanic studies were paralleled by a similar number of bryological works. \
																			He wrote a monograph of Sphagnum for North American Flora as well as many other articles on mosses. \
																			His reputation as a Sphagnum expert was a result of his meticulous and thorough studies. \
																			The years of cooperation between Andrews and the Department of Botany at Cornell benefited them both. \
																			Andrews volunteered his time and expertise to identify mosses, lead student field trips, \
																			and assemble a bryophyte collection in the Wiegand Herbarium. \
																			In 1953, Andrews was appointed Honorary Curator of the bryophyte collection, \
																			and he continued to work on bryophytes until his death in 1961. \
																			His treatise on The Bryophyte Flora of the Upper Cayuga Lake Basin, New York \
																			(Cornell Univ. Agr. Exper. Sta. Memoir 352, publ. Dec. 1957) has become a classic.",
